# Polygraph Substitution Cipher

A Polygraph substitution cipher is a form of substitution cipher that replaces pairs of **n** letters in the plaintext with other pairs of **n** letters in the ciphertext.

The primary goal is to obscure the relationship between individual letters in the plaintext, making it more difficult for attackers to decipher the message.

## Encryption:

-   Divide the plaintext into pairs of letters (polygraphs). If the number of letters is not of sufficient length, you can choose to add a filler character or ignore the unpaired letter.
-   Use a Polygraphic Cipher Algorithm.

## Decryption:

-   Divide the ciphertext into pairs of letters (polygraphs).
-   Use a Polygraphic Decipher Algorithm.
