# Substitution Cipher

A substitution cipher is a type of cryptographic technique that involves replacing each letter or symbol in the **plaintext** with another letter or symbol according to a predetermined rule or key.

The main idea behind a substitution cipher is to obscure the original message in such a way that only those who possess the key can decipher it.

## Types of Substitution Cipher

Substitution Ciphers can be classified into two main types:

-   **Monoalphabetic**: In a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a single fixed letter in the ciphertext.

    This type of cipher uses a fixed substitution pattern, where each letter is consistently replaced by the same letter throughout the message.

-   **Polyalphabetic**: In a polyalphabetic substitution cipher, each letter in the plaintext can be replaced by multiple different letters in the ciphertext, depending on its position or the key used. This provides greater complexity and security compared to monoalphabetic ciphers.
